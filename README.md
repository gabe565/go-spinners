This repo is autogenerated from [sindresorhus/cli-spinners](https://github.com/sindresorhus/cli-spinners).

Intended to be used with [schollz/progressbar](https://github.com/schollz/progressbar), but the spinners will work with any tool that accepts a `[]string`.

go get github.com/gabe565/go-spinners
```

## Usage
